    "# Part 3 of the Exercise\n",
    "## What makes this data interesting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the rental listings we scraped, there are several aspects that make this data particularly valuable:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have a rich set of **structured data points** including:\n",
    "- Rental prices (both cold and warm rent)\n",
    "- Apartment sizes ranging from 20m² to over 200m²\n",
    "- Room counts from 1 to 5 bedrooms\n",
    "- Various amenities like balconies, basements, and elevators\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the **geographic distribution** is fascinating! The data covers diverse neighborhoods across Kiel - from Gaarden-Ost and Mettenhof to upscale areas like Blücherplatz. This gives us a great opportunity to analyze location-based price differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, there are interesting **property quality indicators** like:\n",
    "- Building condition descriptions (\"Neuwertig,\" \"Saniert,\" \"Gepflegt\")\n",
    "- Construction years (some dating back to 1900!)\n",
    "- Various amenity combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Addressing the specific questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Are there labels for supervised ML?\n",
    "The data provides several potential target variables we could predict:\n",
    "- Rental prices would be perfect for regression models\n",
    "- Property conditions could be used for classification\n",
    "- We could even predict property types based on features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Does the data contain network structures?\n",
    "No, this dataset doesn't have social network elements like replies or shares. Each listing stands alone as an independent property offering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Could we build a RAG system?\n",
    "A retrieval-augmented generation system would work well with this data. We could combine the structured property attributes with the text descriptions to create a system that answers natural language queries about housing options in Kiel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed use case: Rental Price Prediction & Recommendation Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "A system could be built that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Predicts fair rental prices** based on features like location, size, and amenities\n",
    "   - This would help students like us know if we're getting a good deal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analyzes neighborhood affordability**\n",
    "   - My data shows huge price disparities: from €300 for a small place in Dietrichsdorf to €3,400 for luxury apartments near Schrevenpark\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creates personalized recommendations**\n",
    "   - Imagine telling the system \"I need a 2-bedroom with a balcony near the university for under €700\" and getting matching options\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Provides natural language insights**\n",
    "   - A conversational interface could make apartment hunting much easier\n",
    "\n"
